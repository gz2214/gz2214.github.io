           I was raised by Chinese immigrants in Metro Detroit. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2019, majoring in Statistics while also minoring in Asian Languages and Cultures with a Chinese Concentration (但是，我的中文水平还很低!). I am currently a Data Science Master's student at New York University, expecting to graduate in December 2024. I am also working full time as a data analyst for the Wisconsin Foundation Alumni Association.
           My goal is to become a data scientist to create positive impact. Some of my interests are related to public policy, health care, and public infrastructure.

           Some of my hobbies include tennis, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE9m3GVECU0' target="_blank">breakin' (breakdancing)</a>, cooking, and gaming. I am an avid  <a href="https://ch.tetr.io/u/itcanbeworse" target="_blank">tetris</a> player, so if you ever want to go rounds let me know!
